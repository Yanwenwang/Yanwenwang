							Hi, my name is Yanwen, some people call me Yan for short.  I am a front end developer that enjoys coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  My focus is on the AngularJS framework.  I also love doing design work as well and will jump into photoshop to touch up images.
						</p>
						<p>
							I grew up in China and after I graduated from college, I had the chance to come to the United States because my father was able to apply for a green card for me and Iâ€™ve been here ever since.
						</p>
						<p>
							I enjoy taking pictures, eating at nice restaraunts, keeping up with the latest technolgy, and traveling the world.

							Programming
						</h3>
						<p>
							My first encounter with technology was when I was in elementary school and MSN Messenger first came out.  I thought it was amazing that I could live chat with anyone around the world.  I told myself that someday I wanted to work on something like that.
						</p>
						<p>
							When I came to the US, I started learning English while working as a law office secretary, life insurance sales person, and ophthalmologist medical assistant.  However, on the side I was constantly learning programming because I wanted to follow my dream.
						</p>
						<p>
							I took courses at Udacity, Khan Academy, W3Schools, Codecademy, PluralSight, and Maker Square.  In addition, I read books such as Eloquent JavaScript and JavaScript the Good Parts.  Now that I have experience HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AngularJS.  I am really excited to start making a difference in the world.
